# BartenderGPT-FinalProject

My app, "Dane's Bartender GPT", is a tool you can use to generate your own cocktail receipies and get inspiration from what you have on hand. Simply take a photo of your ingredients and upload it to the website where it will be processed and a list of recipes using your ingredients will be generated. If you don't want to use a photo, you can also manually select your ingredients (by toggling the grey arrow in the upper left on mobile devices) and generate a list of recipes that way.

Have fun!
